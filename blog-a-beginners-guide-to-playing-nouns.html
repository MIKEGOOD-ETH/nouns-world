        <p><b>Welcome to Nouns, Anon.</b></p>
        <p>This blog post is intended to be a ‚ÄúQuick Start Guide‚Äù ‚Äî Giving you a curated list of ways to contribute to Nouns on a weekly basis <b>(even if you don‚Äôt own a Noun).</b>
        </p>

        <p>As you can see on the Nouns.World landing page there are a number of resources for users, some with overlapping feature sets. <b>To help you through the selection process I‚Äôm suggesting the following resources to new users simply looking for a place to begin.</b></p>


        <h3>Top things to do in Nouns each week in Nouns:</h3>
        <hr>
        <h3>1. Read and Vote on Proposals:</h3>

        <img src="images/blog-quick-start-guide-images/nouns-game-screenshot.png" alt="nouns.game" class="logo-img">
        <p>The number one way I believe you can contribute to Nouns on a weekly basis is to read and vote on live proposals.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Onchain Vote:</b> Visit <a href="https://www.nouns.game/play">Nouns.Game/play</a> or <a href="https://www.nouns.camp/">Nouns.Camp</a> and connect your wallet to vote with or without a Noun. Voting here, with or without a reason (VWR), will cast your vote on-chain for others to see regardless if you have Nouns votes or not. <b>This is a good way to gain recognition in the community: Through thoughtful VWR‚Äôs.</b></li>
            <br>
            <li><b>Zero Weight Vote:</b> The <a href="https://warpcast.com/zeroweight">@ZeroWeight</a> account on Warpcast posts each proposal. Anyone can add a +FOR, +AGAINST, or +ABSTAIN in the comments. Zero Weight takes the average vote and casts a vote for the group with weight. The number of votes fluctuates depending on who is delegating their votes to the Zero Weight experiment.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>If you‚Äôre new to Nouns, it‚Äôs always good to read over past proposals to see what the DAO has been funding recently and what may not have passed. This will give you a better understanding of the current ‚Äòtaste‚Äô the DAO has for funding different types of ideas. 
        </p>

    <img src="images/blog-quick-start-guide-images/nouncil-screenshot.png" alt="nouncil">

        <p>Nouncil is a group of Nouns builders who have Nouns delegated to them. Each week proposers come to the call to share their proposals with the group. Anyone can join the calls, and it‚Äôs a great way to listen in and hear builders present their ideas live. <b>Have questions about Nouns?</b> Ask in the Nouncil voice chat during the call and the community will help you out üëç</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Nouncil Call:</b> Hosted in the <a href="https://discord.gg/XaVNuqMC9k">Nouncil Discord Server</a> every Thursday beginning at 10 am EST.</li>

        <h3>4. Join the daily Noun O Clock show:</h3>

    <img src="images/blog-quick-start-guide-images/nounoclock-banner.png" alt="noun-o-clock">

        <p>Every day as a new Noun is born The Noun Square hosts a show to congratulate the winner of the previous day‚Äôs Noun and to help bring the new Noun to life by playing <a href="https://fomonouns.wtf/">FOMO Nouns:</a> A game used to help select the next Nouns!</p>

        <p><b>Because the auction ends at a new time each day, the show‚Äôs time slot also moves.</b> They go live 5-10 minutes before the current auction ends.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Join in daily on <a href="https://alpha.tavern.fm/profiles/0x4aa5626e97935bf5bea178dab38642b7170ca04a">Tavern.</a></li>

        <p>You don‚Äôt have to own a Noun to participate in Nouns but the auction proceeds are how we keep this experiment going and funding fun, innovative ideas. <b>Bid on a Noun now at:</b></p>

       <h3>6. Add a Candidate Proposal:</h3>
    <img src="images/blog-quick-start-guide-images/candidate-screenshot.png" alt="candidate">



        <p>This isn‚Äôt necessarily something I‚Äôd suggest doing daily or weekly, but if you have a great idea it‚Äôs important to know you do not have to own a Noun to submit the idea as a ‚ÄúCandidate.‚Äù</p>

        <p><b>Anyone can add a Candidate Proposal.</b> Other participants may leave feedback and vote ‚Äúsignals‚Äù on these ideas. These proposals can be edited by the proposer as they get feedback.</p>

        <p>If an idea gets enough ‚ÄúSponsors‚Äù (currently two nouns are needed to sponsor an idea) the proposal can be graduated onchain as a full proposal. <b>Submit Candidate proposal here:</b></p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://nouns.wtf/create-candidate">Nouns.wtf/create-candidate</a></li>
