            <h3>TLDR:</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.leagueofbuddies.com/" target="_blank">Stoopid Buddy Stoodios</a> brings Nouns to life in the 2023 Rose Bowl Parade and produces a documentary about the events leading up to and through the main event!</p>
            <hr>   

            <h3>Details:</h3>
            <p>Nouns funded Stoopid Buddy Stoodios to create a Rose Bowl Parade float and a full-length documentary via Proposal 73: “Nouns Around Town - a Documentary Film Proposal from the Makers of Robot Chicken.”</p>

            <img src="images/stoopid-buddy-rose-bowl-collage-01.png" alt="stoopid-buddy-nouns-costumes" class="blog-header-image">

            <p>The team successfully produced a Nouns Rose Bowl Parade float, putting on an incredible show that was broadcast on national television, reaching over 50 million viewers worldwide.</p>


            <p>They also produced six full-sized Nouns costumes that were worn during the Parade, in skits leading up to the parade, and made appearances at the documentary premiere and after-party.</p>

            <p>The Stoopid Buddy team collaborated with Nouns OTG to bring the Rose Bowl Parade to life, adding on-the-ground support, performers, and merchandise. Their efforts are showcased through various videos and media coverage.</p>


            <p>The entire process was documented in a feature-length documentary, “Shark, Pickle, Cone.” The team premiered the documentary at Consensus in Austin, TX, on May 29, 2024 where they invited DAO members and guests to be the first to watch.</p>

            <h3>Shark, Pickle, Cone</h3>
            <p>The documentary not only showcases the hard work behind the Nouns Rose Bowl Parade float but also highlights the dynamic of the DAO during the filming (mid-2022 to early 2023). It captures the love, passion, and dedication for Nouns, a decentralized brand, and on-chain community.</p>

            <p>The full documentary can be watched at <a href="http://www.SharkPickleCone.wtf" target="_blank">SharkPickleCone.wtf</a></p>
